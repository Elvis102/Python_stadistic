# Learning Statistics with Python


I am a huge fan of <a href="https://djnavarro.net" target="_blank">Danielle Navarro</a>'s book <a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com" target="_blank">Learning Statistics with R</a>. It is the most accessible statistics book I know of. My students love it. I love it. It's free, and it comes in not only R, but also JASP and JAMOVI flavors. The only problem is, I need to teach intro stats using Python, not R. What to do? Translate the book, obviously!

Since Danielle has been so kind as to open-source the book, I have gone to work translating the R bits to Python, and am learning a lot along the way. Hard to say how far I'll get, but for now I'm having fun, and am excited that the students in my course won't have to forego this fantastic book, just because they need to do their stats in Python.

#### Log

06-04-2021 Converted project to jupyterbook format, and added placeholder for all chapters. Currently halfway through code conversion in chapter 4.4 on estimation from a sample.

26-03-2021 Finished correlation section rough draft, and am halfway through binomial distribution section. I am continuing to just focus on the code blocks, leaving text editing for later.

23-03-2021 I have removed the section on mean absolute deviation, because... I dunno, I think I just wanted to hurry on to standard deviation, and I was worrying that students in my course might get bogged down. But then I got to the bit about median absolute deviation, and felt a twinge of regret at taking out mean absolute deviation. So maybe I'll go back and add it back in at some point.

22-03-2021 I'm mostly just concentrating on converting the R code to Python for now. There is much work to be done adapting the text to change the references to the way R works to the way Python works. I have entirely skipped Part 2 for now, because this is 100% R-specific.
