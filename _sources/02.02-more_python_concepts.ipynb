    "In the chapter on [Getting started with Python](getting-started-with-python) our main goal was to, well, get started with Python. As we go through the book we'll run into a lot of new  Python concepts, which I'll explain alongside the relevant data analysis concepts. However, there's still quite a few things that I need to talk about now, otherwise we'll run into problems when we start trying to work with data and do statistics. So that's the goal in this chapter: to build on the introductory content from the last chapter, to get you to the point that we can start using Python for statistics. Broadly speaking, the chapter comes in two parts. The first half of the chapter is devoted to the \"mechanics\" of Python: installing and loading packages, managing the workspace, navigating the file system, and loading and saving data. In the second half, I'll talk more about what kinds of variables exist in Python, and introduce three new kinds of variables: factors, data frames and formulas. I'll finish up by talking a little bit about the help documentation in Python as well as some other avenues for finding assistance. In general, I'm not trying to be comprehensive in this chapter, I'm trying to make sure that you've got the basic foundations needed to tackle the content that comes later in the book. However, a lot of the topics are revisited in more detail later. "

Although it has its quirks and peculiarities like any language (programming or natural), it is relatively flexible and welcoming to newcomers, while still be very, very powerful. But one of the best things about Python isn't even the language itself, it is the rich ecosystem of code written by other people that you can use to make Python do things for you. These **libraries** or **packages** [^note2] contain code that people have written to solve particular problems, and then kindly made available for other people, like you and me, so that we don't have to spend our time reinventing the wheel. By installing and importing libraries, you can achieve very complicated things with only a few lines of your own code, by standing on the shoulders of others.

    "When doing anything other than the very most basic forms of data analysis in Python, we will almost always need to use libraries. However, before we get started, there's a critical distinction that you need to understand, which is the difference between having a package **_installed_** on your computer, and having a package **_imported_** in Python. I do not have any idea how many Python libraries are available out there, but it is a lot. Thousands. If you install Python on your computer, you won't get all of them, just a handfull of the standard ones. Depending on how you install Python on your computer, you may have more or fewer libraries installed, but either way, there are thousands more out there that you do not currently have installed. So that's what installed means: it means \"it's on your computer somewhere\". The critical thing to remember is that just because something is on your computer doesn't mean Python can use it. In order for Python to be able to *use* one of your installed libraries, that library must also be \"imported\". Basically what it boils down to is this:\n",

    ">A library must be installed before it can be imported.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I won't get into the details of installing libraries here, simply because it is too much for me to tackle. If you are using Python in an online enviroment, you may already have access to all the libraries mentioned in this book. If you are working with Python on your own computer, the exact details of how you install packages may vary. If you want to use Python on your own computer, and are just getting started, I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) as a relatively easy way to install Python and get quick access to all the most common and important libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note4]: Basically, the reason is that there are thousands of libraries, and probably thousands of authors of libraries, and no-one really knows what all of them do. Keeping the installation separate from the loading minimizes the chances that two libraries will interact with each other in a nasty way. "

    "### What libraries does this book use?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, I have made a concerted effort to limit the number of libraries needed. Often you will find that you can use different libraries to achieve the same results, and sometimes one of these may suit your needs more than another. This is something that can make doing analysis by code rather than pointing and clicking in a dedicated statistics program a bit off-putting; in Excel, there is usually only way to do things, while in Python, there are many. I think this is part of what makes doing statistics using code better, though: you can make your own informed choices, and do *exactly* the analysis you want to do; you don't have to accept some piece of software's default settings. However, point of this book is to get you started doing data analysis and statistics in Python, not to show you all the different ways you could achieve the same goal, so in an effort to keep things simple, I have tried to limit the libraries used in this book to a few of the most important and most common ones for doing statistics with Python. The most prominent ones are: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statistics`, `math`, and `statsmodels`, but I may use others as well, as needed.\n",

But, normally I will, because I want the code snippets in this book to be as easy as possible to copy and paste into your own computer. If I don't put the `import` command at the top of the snippet, and you have not already imported the library, then you might copy and paste my code into your computer and get an error message. Then again, sometimes I might forget to put the import statement in, or I might think it should be obvious, or I might just get lazy, so make sure to keep an eye out for this!\n",

Regardless of whether you're using Window, macOS or Linux, every file on the computer is assigned a (fairly) human readable address, and every address has the same basic structure: it describes a *path* that starts from a *root* location, through as series of *folders* (or if you're an old-school computer user, *directories*), and finally ends up at the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a Windows computer the root is the physical drive [^note4] on which the file is stored, and for most home computers the name of the hard drive that stores all your files is C: and therefore most file names on Windows begin with C:. After that come the folders, and on Windows the folder names are separated by a `\\` symbol. So, the complete path to this book on my Windows computer might be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\danRbook\\pythonbook.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "and what that *means* is that the book is called LSR.pdf, and it's in a folder called `book` which itself is in a folder called dan which itself is ... well, you get the idea. On Linux, Unix and Mac OS systems, the addresses look a little different, but they're more or less identical in spirit. Instead of using the backslash, folders are separated using a forward slash, and unlike Windows, they don't treat the physical drive as being the root of the file system. So, the path to this book on my Mac might be something like this:\n",

A quick search will lead you to many many online tutorials; just find a method that works for you, on your computer.\n",

After all, there's no point in storing information if you don't use it, and there's no way to use information if you can't access it. So let's talk a bit about how to pull information out of a data frame. \n",

As is always the case with R there are several ways. The simplest way is to use the `$` operator to extract the variable you're interested in, like this:\n",

Normally you might try to type `objects()` or `who()`, but neither of those commands will tell you what the names are for those variables inside a data frame! One way is to ask R to tell you what the *names* of all the variables stored in the data frame are, which you can do using the `names()` function:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "names(expt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "An alternative method is to use the `who()` function, as long as you tell it to look at the variables inside data frames.

That is:\n",

    "who(expand = TRUE)\n",

    "## Lists{#lists}\n",
    "\n",
    "The next kind of data I want to mention are **_lists_**. Lists are an extremely fundamental data structure in R, and as you start making the transition from a novice to a savvy R user you will use lists all the time. I don't use lists very often in this book -- not directly -- but most of the advanced data structures in R are built from lists (e.g., data frames are actually a specific type of list). Because lists are so important to how R stores things, it's useful to have a basic understanding of them. Okay, so what is a list, exactly? Like data frames, lists are just \"collections of variables.\" However, unlike data frames -- which are basically supposed to look like a nice \"rectangular\" table of data -- there are no constraints on what kinds of variables we include, and no requirement that the variables have any particular relationship to one another. In order to understand what this actually *means*, the best thing to do is create a list, which we can do using the `list()` function. If I type this as my command:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "Dan <- list( age = 34,\n",
    "            nerd = TRUE,\n",
    "            parents = c(\"Joe\",\"Liz\") \n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "R creates a new list variable called `Dan`, which is a bundle of three different variables: `age`, `nerd` and `parents`. Notice, that the `parents` variable is longer than the others. This is perfectly acceptable for a list, but it wouldn't be for a data frame. If we now print out the variable, you can see the way that R stores the list:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "print( Dan )\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you might have guessed from those `$` symbols everywhere, the variables are stored in exactly the same way that they are for a data frame (again, this is not surprising: data frames *are* a type of list). So you will (I hope) be entirely unsurprised and probably quite bored when I tell you that you can extract the variables from the list using the `$` operator, like so:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "Dan$nerd\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you need to add new entries to the list, the easiest way to do so is to again use `$`, as the following example illustrates. If I type a command like this\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "Dan$children <- \"Alex\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "then R creates a new entry to the end of the list called `children`, and assigns it a value of `\"Alex\"`. If I were now to `print()` this list out, you'd see a new entry at the bottom of the printout. Finally, it's actually possible for lists to contain other lists, so it's quite possible that I would end up using a command like `Dan$children$age` to find out how old my son is. Or I could try to remember it myself I suppose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulas{#formulas}\n",
    " \n",
    "The last kind of variable that I want to introduce before finally being able to start talking about statistics is the **_formula_**. Formulas were originally introduced into R as a convenient way to specify a particular type of statistical model (see Chapter \\@ref(regression)) but they're such handy things that they've spread. Formulas are now used in a lot of different contexts, so it makes sense to introduce them early.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stated simply, a formula object is a variable, but it's a special type of variable that specifies a relationship between other variables. A formula is specified using the \"tilde operator\" `~`. A very simple example of a formula is shown below:^[Note that, when I write out the formula, R doesn't check to see if the `out` and `pred` variables actually exist: it's only later on when you try to use the formula for something that this happens.]\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "formula1 <- out ~ pred\n",
    "formula1\n",
    "```\n",
    "The *precise* meaning of this formula depends on exactly what you want to do with it, but in broad terms it means \"the `out` (outcome) variable, analysed in terms of the `pred` (predictor) variable\". That said, although the simplest and most common form of a formula uses the  \"one variable on the left, one variable on the right\" format, there are others. For instance, the following examples are all reasonably common\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "formula2 <-  out ~ pred1 + pred2   # more than one variable on the right\n",
    "formula3 <-  out ~ pred1 * pred2   # different relationship between predictors \n",
    "formula4 <-  ~ var1 + var2         # a 'one-sided' formula\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generic functions{#generics}\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one really important thing that I omitted when I discussed functions earlier on in Section \\@ref(usingfunctions), and that's the concept of a **_generic function_**. The two most notable examples that you'll see in the next few chapters are `summary()` and `plot()`, although you've already seen an example of one working behind the scenes, and that's the `print()` function. The thing that makes generics different from the other functions is that their behaviour changes, often quite dramatically, depending on the `class()` of the input you give it. The easiest way to explain the concept is with an example. With that in mind, lets take a closer look at what the `print()` function actually does. I'll do this by creating a formula, and printing it out in a few different ways. First, let's stick with what we know:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "my.formula <- blah ~ blah.blah    # create a variable of class \"formula\"\n",
    "print( my.formula )               # print it out using the generic print() function\n",
    "```\n",
    "So far, there's nothing very surprising here. But there's actually a lot going on behind the scenes here. When I type `print( my.formula )`, what actually happens is the `print()` function checks the class of the `my.formula` variable. When the function discovers that the variable it's been given is a formula, it goes looking for a function called `print.formula()`, and then delegates the whole business of printing out the variable to the `print.formula()` function.^[For readers with a programming background: what I'm describing is the very basics of how S3 methods work. However, you should be aware that R has two entirely distinct systems for doing object oriented programming, known as S3 and S4. Of the two, S3 is simpler and more informal, whereas S4 supports all the stuff that you might expect of a fully object oriented language. Most of the generics we'll run into in this book use the S3 system, which is convenient for me because I'm still trying to figure out S4. ] For what it's worth, the name for a \"dedicated\" function like `print.formula()` that exists only to be a special case of a generic function like `print()` is a **_method_**, and the name for the process in which the generic function passes off all the hard work onto a method is called **_method dispatch_**. You won't need to understand the details at all for this book, but you do need to know the gist of it; if only because a lot of the functions we'll use are actually generics. Anyway, to help expose a little more of the workings to you, let's bypass the `print()` function entirely and call the formula method directly:\n",
    "```{r eval=FALSE}\n",
    "print.formula( my.formula )       # print it out using the print.formula() method\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appears to be deprecated\n",
    "```\n",
    "There's no difference in the output at all. But this shouldn't surprise you because it was actually the `print.formula()` method that was doing all the hard work in the first place. The `print()` function itself is a lazy bastard that doesn't do anything other than select which of the methods is going to do the actual printing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, fair enough, but you might be wondering what would have happened if `print.formula()` didn't exist? That is, what happens if there isn't a specific method defined for the class of variable that you're using? In that case, the generic function passes off the hard work to a \"default\" method, whose name in this case would be `print.default()`. Let's see what happens if we bypass the `print()` formula, and try to print out `my.formula` using the  `print.default()` function:\n",
    "```{r}\n",
    "print.default( my.formula )      # print it out using the print.default() method\n",
    "```\n",
    "Hm. You can kind of see that it is trying to print out the same formula, but there's a bunch of ugly low-level details that have also turned up on screen. This is because the `print.default()` method doesn't know anything about formulas, and doesn't know that it's supposed to be hiding the obnoxious internal gibberish that R produces sometimes. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, this is about as much as we need to know about generic functions and their methods. In fact, you can get through the entire book without learning any more about them than this, so it's probably a good idea to end this discussion here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting help{#help}\n",
    "\n",
    "The very last topic I want to mention in this chapter is where to go to find help. Obviously, I've tried to make this book as helpful as possible, but it's not even close to being a comprehensive guide, and there's thousands of things it doesn't cover. So where should you go for help? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to read the help documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "I have somewhat mixed feelings about the help documentation in R. On the plus side, there’s a lot of it, and it’s very thorough. On the minus side, there’s a lot of it, and it’s very thorough. There’s so much help documentation that it sometimes doesn’t help, and most of it is written with an advanced user in mind. Often it feels like most of the help ﬁles work on the assumption that the reader already understands everything about R except for the speciﬁc topic that it’s providing help for. What that means is that, once you’ve been using R for a long time and are beginning to get a feel for how to use it, the help documentation is awesome. These days, I ﬁnd myself really liking the help ﬁles (most of them anyway). But when I ﬁrst started using R I found it very dense.\n",
    "\n",
    "To some extent, there’s not much I can do to help you with this. You just have to work at it yourself; once you’re moving away from being a pure beginner and are becoming a skilled user, you’ll start ﬁnding the help documentation more and more helpful. In the meantime, I’ll help as much as I can by trying to explain to you what you’re looking at when you open a help ﬁle. To that end, let’s look at the help documentation for the `load()` function. To do so, I type either of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r eval=FALSE}\n",
    "?load \n",
    "help(\"load\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When I do that, R goes looking for the help ﬁle for the \"load\" topic. If it ﬁnds one, Rstudio takes it and displays it in the help panel. Alternatively, you can try a fuzzy search for a help topic\n",
    "\n",
    "```{r eval=FALSE}\n",
    "??load \n",
    "help.search(\"load\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will bring up a list of possible topics that you might want to follow up in. Regardless, at some point you’ll ﬁnd yourself looking at an actual help ﬁle. And when you do, you’ll see there’s a quite a lot of stuﬀ written down there, and it comes in a pretty standardised format. So let’s go through it slowly, using the \"`load`\" topic as our example. Firstly, at the very top we see this:\n",
    "```{block2, type='rmdnote'}\n",
    "<table width=\"100%\" summary=\"page for load {base}\"><tr><td>load {base}</td><td style=\"text-align: right;\">R Documentation</td></tr></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Reload Saved Datasets</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5>Description</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Reload datasets written with the function <code>save</code>.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fairly straightforward. The next section describes how the function is used:\n",
    "```{block2, type='rmdnote'}\n",
    "<h5>Usage</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "load(file, envir = parent.frame(), verbose = FALSE)\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this instance, the usage section is actually pretty readable. It’s telling you that there are two arguments to the `load()` function: the ﬁrst one is called `file`, and the second one is called `envir`. It’s also telling you that there is a default value for the envir argument; so if the user doesn’t specify what the value of envir should be, then R will assume that `envir = parent.frame()`. In contrast, the file argument has no default value at all, so the user must specify a value for it. So in one sense, this section is very straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem, of course, is that you don’t know what the `parent.frame()` function actually does, so it’s hard for you to know what the `envir = parent.frame()` bit is all about. What you could do is then go look up the help documents for the `parent.frame()` function (and sometimes that’s actually a good idea), but often you’ll ﬁnd that the help documents for those functions are just as dense (if not more dense) than the help ﬁle that you’re currently reading. As an alternative, my general approach when faced with something like this is to skim over it, see if I can make any sense of it. If so, great. If not, I ﬁnd that the best thing to do is ignore it. In fact, the ﬁrst time I read the help ﬁle for the load() function, I had no idea what any of the `envir` related stuﬀ was about. But fortunately I didn’t have to: the default setting here (i.e., `envir = parent.frame()`) is actually the thing you want in about 99% of cases, so it’s safe to ignore it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, what I’m trying to say is: don’t let the scary, incomprehensible parts of the help ﬁle intimidate you. Especially because there’s often some parts of the help ﬁle that will make sense. Of course, I guarantee you that sometimes this strategy will lead you to make mistakes... often embarrassing mistakes. But it’s still better than getting paralysed with fear. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, let’s continue on. The next part of the help documentation discusses each of the arguments, and what they’re supposed to do:\n",
    "```{block2, type='rmdnote'}\n",
    "<h5>Arguments</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "<table summary=\"R argblock\">\n",
    "<tr valign=\"top\"><td><code>file</code></td>\n",
    "<td>\n",
    "<p>a (readable binary-mode) <a href=\"../../base/help/connection\">connection</a> or a character string\n",
    "giving the name of the file to load (when <a href=\"../../base/help/tilde expansion\">tilde expansion</a>\n",
    "is done).</p>\n",
    "</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr valign=\"top\"><td><code>envir</code></td>\n",
    "<td>\n",
    "<p>the environment where the data should be loaded.</p>\n",
    "</td></tr>\n",
    "<tr valign=\"top\"><td><code>verbose</code></td>\n",
    "<td>\n",
    "<p>should item names be printed during loading?</p>\n",
    "</td></tr>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so what this is telling us is that the `file` argument needs to be a string (i.e., text data) which tells R the name of the ﬁle to load. It also seems to be hinting that there’s other possibilities too (e.g., a “binary mode connection”), and you probably aren’t quite sure what “tilde expansion” means^[It’s extremely simple, by the way. We discussed it in Section 4.4, though I didn’t call it by that name. Tilde expansion is the thing where R recognises that, in the context of specifying a ﬁle location, the tilde symbol ~ corresponds to the user home directory (e.g., /Users/dan/).]. But overall, the meaning is pretty clear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning to the `envir` argument, it’s now a little clearer what the Usage section was babbling about. The `envir` argument speciﬁes the name of an environment (see Section 4.3 if you’ve forgotten what environments are) into which R should place the variables when it loads the ﬁle. Almost always, this is a no-brainer: you want R to load the data into the same damn environment in which you’re invoking the `load()` command. That is, if you’re typing `load()` at the R prompt, then you want the data to be loaded into your workspace (i.e., the global environment). But if you’re writing your own function that needs to load some data, you want the data to be loaded inside that function’s private workspace. And in fact, that’s exactly what the `parent.frame()` thing is all about. It’s telling the `load()` function to send the data to the same place that the `load()` command itself was coming from.

    "- The Rseek website (www.rseek.org). One thing that I really find annoying about the R help documentation is that it's hard to search properly. When coupled with the fact that the documentation is dense and highly technical, it's often a better idea to search or ask online for answers to your questions. With that in mind, the Rseek website is great: it's an R specific search engine. I find it really useful, and it's almost always my first port of call when I'm looking around.\n",
    "- The R-help mailing list (see http://www.r-project.org/mail.html for details). This is the official R help mailing list. It can be very helpful, but it's *very* important that you do your homework before posting a question. The list gets a lot of traffic. While the people on the list try as hard as they can to answer questions, they do so for free, and you *really* don't want to know how much money they could charge on an hourly rate if they wanted to apply market rates. In short, they are doing you a favour, so be polite. Don't waste their time asking questions that can be easily answered by a quick search on Rseek (it's rude), make sure your question is clear, and all of the relevant information is included. In short, read the posting guidelines carefully (http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html), and make use of the `help.request()` function that R provides to check that you're actually doing what you're expected.\n",

    "This chapter continued where Chapter \\@ref(introR) left off. The focus was still primarily on introducing basic R concepts, but this time at least you can see how those concepts are related to data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Installing, loading and updating packages](#packageinstall). Knowing how to extend the functionality of R by installing and using packages is critical to becoming an effective R user\n",
    "- Getting around. Section \\@ref(workspace) talked about how to manage your workspace and how to keep it tidy. Similarly, Section \\@ref(navigation) talked about how to get R to interact with the rest of the file system.\n",
    "- [Loading and saving data](#load). Finally, we encountered actual data files. Loading and saving data is obviously a crucial skill, one we discussed in Section \\@ref(load).\n",
    "- [Useful things to know about variables](#useful). In particular, we talked about special values, element names and classes.\n",
    "- More complex types of variables. R has a number of important variable types that will be useful when analysing real data. I talked about factors in Section \\@ref(factors), data frames in Section \\@ref(dataframes), lists in Section \\@ref(lists) and formulas in Section \\@ref(formulas).\n",
    "- [Generic functions](#generics). How is it that some function seem to be able to do lots of different things? Section \\@ref(generics) tells you how.\n",
    "- [Getting help](#help). Assuming that you're not looking for counselling, Section \\@ref(help) covers several possibilities. If you are looking for counselling, well, this book really can't help you there. Sorry. \n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, Chapters \\@ref(introR) and \\@ref(mechanics) provide enough of a background that you can finally get started doing some statistics! Yes, there's a lot more R concepts that you ought to know (and we'll talk about some of them in Chapters\\@ref(datahandling) and\\@ref(scripting)), but I think that we've talked quite enough about programming for the moment. It's time to see how your experience with programming can be used to do some data analysis..."
