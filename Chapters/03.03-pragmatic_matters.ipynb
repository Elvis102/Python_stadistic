    "This is a somewhat strange chapter, even by my standards. My goal in this chapter is to talk a bit more honestly about the realities of working with data than you'll see anywhere else in the book. The problem with real world data sets is that they are *messy*. Very often the data file that you start out with doesn't have the variables stored in the right format for the analysis you want to do. Sometimes might be a lot of missing values in your data set. Sometimes you only want to analyse a subset of the data. Et cetera. In other words, there's a lot of **_data manipulation_** that you need to do, just to get all your data set into the format that you need it. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a basic introduction to all these pragmatic topics. Although the chapter is motivated by the kinds of practical issues that arise when manipulating real data, I'll stick with the practice that I've adopted through most of the book and rely on very small, toy data sets that illustrate the underlying issue. Because this chapter is essentially a collection of \"tricks\" and doesn't tell a single coherent story, it may be useful to start with a list of topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Dataframes](pandas)\n",
    "- [Tabulating data](freqtables)\n",
    "- [Transforming or recoding a variable](transform)\n",
    "- [Some useful mathematical functions](mathfunc)\n",
    "- [Slicing](slicing) and dicing\n",
    "- [Extracting a subset of a data frame](subsets)\n",
    "- [Sorting, flipping or merging data sets](manipulations)\n",
    "- [Reshaping a data frame](reshaping)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I may dump more trick and tips here later, and I'm really only scratching the surface of several fairly different and important topics. My advice, as usual, is to read through the chapter once and try to follow as much of it as you can. Don't worry too much if you can't grasp it all at once, especially the later sections. The rest of the book is only lightly reliant on this chapter, so you can get away with just understanding the basics. However, what you'll probably find is that later on you'll need to flick back to this chapter in order to understand some of the concepts that I refer to here."

    "So there are four variables in active memory: `age`, `rt`, `group` and `score`. And it just so happens that all four of them are the same size (i.e., they're all lists with 9 elements). Aaaand it just so happens that `age[0]` corresponds to the age of the first person, and `rt[0]` is the response time of that very same person, etc. In other words, you and I both know that all four of these variables correspond to the *same* data set, and all four of them are organised in exactly the same way. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, Python *doesn't* know this! As far as it's concerned, there's no reason why the `age` variable has to be the same length as the `rt` variable; and there's no particular reason to think that `age[1]` has any special relationship to `score[1]` any more than it has a special relationship to `score[4]`. In other words, when we store everything in separate variables like this, Python doesn't know anything about the relationships between things. It doesn't even really know that these variables actually refer to a proper data set. The data frame fixes this: if we store our variables inside a data frame, we're telling Python to treat these variables as a single, fairly coherent data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see how they do this, let's create one. So how do we create a data frame? One way we've already seen: if we use `pandas` to [import our data from a CSV file](loadingcsv), it will store it as a data frame. A second way is to create it directly from some existing lists using the `pandas.Dataframe()` function. All you have to do is type a list of variables that you want to include in the data frame. The output is, well, a data frame. So, if I want to store all four variables from my experiment in a data frame called `df` I can do so like this[^notedict]:\n",
    "\n",
    "[^notedict]: Although it really doesn't matter at this point, you may have noticed a new symbol here: the \"curly brackets\" or \"curly braces\". Python uses these to indicate yet another variable type: the dictionary. Here we are using the dictionary variable type in passing to feed our lists into a `pandas` dataframe."

However, often you want your data to be organised in terms of proportions rather than counts. This could be as a proportion of the row totals or the column totals. Currently, these are both just called \"All\", so let's first save the output of our crosstab to a variable, and rename the row and column totals to \"rowtotals\" and \"coltotals\"."

    "## Transforming and recoding a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "It's not uncommon in real world data analysis to find that one of your variables isn't quite equivalent to the variable that you really want. For instance, it's often convenient to take a continuous-valued variable (e.g., age) and break it up into a smallish number of categories (e.g., younger, middle, older). At other times, you may need to convert a numeric variable into a different numeric variable (e.g., you may want to analyse at the absolute value of the original variable). In this section I'll describe a few key tricks that you can make use of to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a transformed variable\n",
    "\n",
    "The first trick to discuss is the idea of **_transforming_** a variable. Taken literally, *anything* you do to a variable is a transformation, but in practice what it usually means is that you apply a relatively simple mathematical function to the original variable, in order to create new variable that either (a) provides a better way of describing the thing you're actually interested in or (b) is more closely in agreement with the assumptions of the statistical tests you want to do.  Since -- at this stage -- I haven't talked about statistical tests or their assumptions, I'll show you an example based on the first case. \n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the explanation simple, the variable we'll try to transform isn't inside a data frame, though in real life it almost certainly would be. However, I think it's useful to start with an example that doesn't use data frames because it illustrates the fact that you already know how to do variable transformations. To see this, let's go through an example. Suppose I've run a short study in which I ask 10 people a single question: \n",

    "However, if you think about it, this isn't the best way to represent these responses.   Because of the fairly symmetric way that we set up the response scale, there's a sense in which the midpoint of the scale should have been coded as 0 (no opinion), and the two endpoints should be $+3$ (strong agree) and $-3$ (strong disagree). By recoding the data in this way, it's a bit more reflective of how we really think about the responses. The recoding here is trivially easy: we just subtract 4 from the raw scores. Since these data are in a list, we can use a \"list comprehension\" to step through each element in the list, and subtract 4 from it:"

    "This output takes a little bit of interpretation, but it's not complicated. What Python has done is determined that the lowest age category should run from 1.94 years up to 21.3 years, the second category should run from 21.3 years to 40.7 years, and so on. These labels are not nearly as easy on the eyes as our \"young, adult, and older\" categories, so it's usually a good idea to specify your own, meaningful labels to the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on, I should take a moment to talk a little about the mechanics of the `cut()` function. Notice that Python has tried to divide the `age` variable into three roughly equal sized bins. Unless you specify the particular breaks you want, that's what it will do. But suppose you want to divide the `age` variable into three categories of different size, but with approximately identical numbers of people. How would you do that? Well, if that's the case, then what you want to do is have the breaks correspond to the 0th, 33rd, 66th and 100th percentiles of the data. One way to do this would be to calculate those values using the `np.quantile()` function and then use those quantiles as input to the `cut()` function. That's pretty easy to do, but it does take a couple of lines to type. So instead, the `pandas` library has a function called `qCut()` that does exactly this:"

    "Notice the difference in the boundaries that the `qcut()` method selects. The first and third categories now span an age range of about 25 years each, whereas the middle category has shrunk to a span of only 6 years. There are some situations where this is genuinely what you want (that's why I wrote the function!), but in general you should be careful. Usually the numeric variable that you're trying to cut into categories is already expressed in meaningful units (i.e., it's interval scale), but if you cut it into unequal bin sizes then it's often very difficult to attach meaningful interpretations to the resulting categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally, regardless of whether you're using the original `cut()` method or the `qcut()` version, it's important to take the time to figure out whether or not the resulting categories make any sense at all in terms of your research project. If they don't make any sense to you as meaningful categories, then any data analysis that uses those categories is likely to be just as meaningless. More generally, in practice I've noticed that people have a very strong desire to carve their (continuous and messy) data into a few (discrete and simple) categories; and then run analysis using the categorised data instead of the original one.[^note2] I wouldn't go so far as to say that this is an inherently bad idea, but it does have some fairly serious drawbacks at times, so I would advise some caution if you are thinking about doing it. \n",
    "\n",
    "[^note2]: If you've read further into the book, and are re-reading this section, then a good example of this would be someone choosing to do an ANOVA using age categories as the grouping variable, instead of running a regression using `age` as a predictor. There are sometimes good reasons for do this: for instance, if the relationship between `age` and your outcome variable is highly non-linear, and you aren't comfortable with trying to run non-linear regression! However, unless you really do have a good rationale for doing this, it's best not to. It tends to introduce all sorts of other problems (e.g., the data will probably violate the normality assumption), and you can lose a lot of power."

Of course, if we’re going to characterise the problem that broadly, then about half of this chapter can probably be thought of as a kind of reshaping. So we’re going to have to narrow things down a little bit. I'm going to begin with two of the most common ways we need to reshape data: moving from wide-format data to long-format data, and moving from long-format data to wide-format data."

Because all of the testing conditions (i.e., the three drug types) are applied to all participants, drug type is an example of a **within-subject** factor.
