# Learning Statistics with Python

(Python Adaptation by Ethan Weed)

I am a huge fan of <a href="https://djnavarro.net" target="_blank">Danielle Navarro</a>'s book <a href="https://learningstatisticswithr.com" target="_blank">Learning Statistics with R</a>. It is the most accessible statistics book I know of. My students love it. I love it. It's free, and it comes in not only R, but also JASP and JAMOVI flavors. The only problem is, I need to teach intro stats using Python, not R. What to do? Translate the book, obviously!

Since Danielle has been so kind as to open-source the book, I have gone to work translating the R bits to Python, and am learning a lot along the way. <del>To start with, I'm concentrating on translating the code, and putting off editing the textual references to R and R-specific functions for later.</del> Having started with just the code, I have now realized that a better approach is to go through the text line-by-line, and do the job properly the first time. It's a bit slower this way, but ultimately better, I think. 

<del>It's hard to say how far I'll get, but for now</del> I'm having fun, and am excited that the students in my course won't have to forego this fantastic book, just because they need to do their stats in Python.

Update: having by now gotten as far as figuring out how to use Python to overlay the probability density for an F-distribution on top of a distribution created by taking the ratio of random samples from two scaled chi-square distributions, I think I'm committed to seeing this thing through.
